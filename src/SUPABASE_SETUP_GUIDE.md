# Supabase Setup Guide

## Your Supabase Connection is ACTIVE

Your app is currently connected to your Supabase project with the following credentials:

- **Project URL**: https://yunwcbujnowcifbkfjmr.supabase.co
- **API Key**: Already configured in the app

## Testing Your Connection

Fill out and submit the email form on your site. If everything is set up correctly:
- The form should submit successfully
- You should see a "Success!" toast message
- The email should be stored in your `deadpunch_email_capture` table in Supabase

## Modifying Your Supabase Settings

If you need to change your Supabase settings in the future, you'll need to update the credentials in the `src/lib/supabase.ts` file.
